# liri

Welcome to my liri app.  In order to start with liri first download the package.json and use

npm install 

to get the modules to run the searches.


You'll also need to get api keys for omdb, spotify, and bandsintown

App runs by doing a command of either

concert-this
searches bandsintown to find concerts for an artist

spotify-this-song
searches spotify for a track, organizes by artist, track title, and album
default is The sign by Ace of Bass

movie-this
searches omdb for a movie including title, actors, year released, reviews, and more
Default is Mr. Nobody

do-what-it-says
runs command from random.txt, that command can be changed to do movies, or concerts, but default is set to spotify
